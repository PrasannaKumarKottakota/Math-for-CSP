Singal Processing can be defined as mathematical techniques used implimented over a function to get the desired output.

In the digital domain, Mathematical representation of a physical wave is a signal. Signal is nothing but a function. Process is nothing but the techniques used to get the desired out for a given input.

Mathematical concepts such as
1. Matrix Analysis & Linear Algebra
2. Probabulity 
3. Random Variables & Processes
are used for the signal processing algorithum development

Since the BBU (Base Band Unit) of SDR is of Signal Processing. So, Mathematics play a key role in the design \& development of SDR.
